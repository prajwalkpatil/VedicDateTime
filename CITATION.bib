abstract={Calendar systems adopted across the world are either solar, lunar or lunisolar, based on the movements of the sun, the moon, or both. The Gregorian (solar) calendars are considered as time references for modern computations. However, Vedic calendars, being lunisolar, can be more effective for the analysis of activities that depend on both celestial bodies. In this paper, we present VedicDateTime, an open-source framework that implements the Vedic calendar and provides conversions for Gregorian dates. Along with package details, we also provide two case studies that make use of the proposed package for time-series analysis. The objective of this paper is to motivate researchers to explore the potential of the Vedic calendar from the perspective of time series analysis.},
